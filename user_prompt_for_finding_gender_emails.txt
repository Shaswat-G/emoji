You are given a Unicode TC email communication. Return ONLY a JSON object that conforms exactly to the provided schema. Do not include any explanation.

Subject: {SUBJECT_LINE}

Body: {BODY}

Tasks:

1. Determine `expliciteness` of gender (identity/presentation in emoji design/policy) in this email: `"none"`, `"passing_mention"`, `"section_level"`, or `"communication_core"`.
2. Estimate `coverage_pct` (0–100) for this email.
3. Select all applicable `subthemes` from the enum list (zero or more).
4. Provide verbatim supporting `evidence` quotes (≤ 4 is fine) with optional `loc` if available.
5. Set `confidence` (1–10) in your labeling.

Important:

* If the email only mentions grammatical gender or unrelated Unicode properties without tying to emoji human gender/identity/presentation, treat as not relevant.
* If evidence is insufficient, output `"none"`, `0`, `[]`, `[]`, and an honest `confidence`.

Output: a single JSON object exactly matching the schema. No extra fields. No commentary.
